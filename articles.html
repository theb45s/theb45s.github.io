				<h2>The B45s at The Phoenix in Fort Wayne, IN on 21-Nov-2014: National Rock Review</h2>
				<p><b>The B45’s are a mix of 60’s beat music and rock and roll full of spunk and talent.</b><br>
				Ben Tarr (guitar and vocals), Colin Taylor (bass and vocals), Kellen Baker (lead guitar and vocals), Sam Clay (drums) are the B45s. They sport three-part Beatlesque harmonies and great originals. All are parts of other bands who came together to play a one-time gig at a retirement home. That one gig made them realize they had chemistry. Three-fourths of the band met in a jazz program at the local community schools, and all were participants in the Rock Camp program at Sweetwater Sound. They are all still in school with Baker being a mere 12 years old...<a href="http://www.nationalrockreview.com/concert-reviews/b45s-fortwayne-in-21nov2014"> Read More </a></p>
				<h2>B45s: Whatzup</h2>
				<p>	Things happen fast in rock n’ roll. One minute you’re throwing a band together to help out a friend, and the next you’re opening for a legendary local band in a 2,750-seat venue.
				Okay. It took a little more than a minute, but for the B45’s the time between their first gig and their upcoming slot ahead of the Bel Airs at the Foellinger Theater is a testament not only to their popularity but to their chops. These guys can play. They play so well it’s easy to forget that no one in the band is old enough to vote...<a href="http://whatzup.com/index.php?f=musicianfeatures&page=B45s_150723"> Read More</a></p>
				<h2>Studies by Day, Jams by Night: Journal Gazette</h2>
				<p><b>Teen bands loaded with talent, changing local music landscape</b><br>The crowd of a couple thousand who had carried their folding chairs and blankets onto the thick grassy areas and wide sidewalks of the downtown library was restless; even uninterested.
				The second band of the evening at May’s Beatlefest droned unemotionally through one song after another with little success of providing a fraction of the famed group’s energy. The only commonality it had with the Beatles was it sang the same lyrics.
				But to cut it some slack, Beatles music wasn’t exactly that group’s specialty. As a result, not long into the band’s 45-minute set, several in the audience milled about or talked as they paid little attention to the uninspiring effort on the plaza stage.
				This is not what some came to see – or hear...<a href="http://www.journalgazette.net/entertainment/Studies-by-day--jams-by-night-8204875"> Read More</a></p>
